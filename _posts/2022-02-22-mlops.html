<h2>Accelerator Description</h2>
<p>
    The ML Ops solution accelerator provides a deployable solution that can be used by development and data science teams to:
    <ul>
        <li>Develop & train model(s) with reusable ML pipelines</li>
        <li>Package model(s) using containers to capture runtime dependencies for inference</li>
        <li>Validate model behavior ‚Äì functionally, in terms of responsiveness, in terms of regulatory compliance</li>
        <li>Deploy model(s) - to cloud & edge, for use in real-time / streaming / batch processing</li>
        <li>Monitor model behavior & business value, know when to replace / deprecate a stale model</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<!-- <p>
    The aim is to bring State-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models quickly into production scenarios particularly around the use of defect detection as seen in many quality control scenarios.
</p>
<p>
    Image Recognition aims to recognize and identify objects in images as well as understanding the content and context. TensorFlow object recognition algorithms classify and identify arbitrary objects within larger images. This is usually used in engineering applications such as social networks for photo tagging. By analyzing thousands of photos of trees for example, the technology can learn to identify a tree in an image it has never seen before.
