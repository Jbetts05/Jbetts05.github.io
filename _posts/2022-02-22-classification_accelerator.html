<h2>Accelerator Description</h2>
<p>
    Binary classification models are perhaps the most common use-case in predictive analytics. The reason is that many key client actions across a wide range of industries are binary in nature, such as:
    <ul>
        <li>defaulting on a loan,</li>
        <li>clicking on an ad,</li>
        <li>terminating a subscription,</li>
        <li>quality control of products, processes or services,</li>
        <li>medical testing,</li>
        <li>and so on.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Because of this broad commonality, this accelerator will prove optimal in many data science-based engagements, streamlining time to value.

    Image Recognition aims to recognize and identify objects in images as well as understanding the content and context. TensorFlow object recognition algorithms classify and identify arbitrary objects within larger images. This is usually used in engineering applications such as social networks for photo tagging. By analyzing thousands of photos of trees for example, the technology can learn to identify a tree in an image it has never seen before.

    <u>Details of the accelerator:</u> 
    <ul>
        <li>Leverages the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/dstoolkit-mlops-base"; style="">ML Ops accelerator</a> to provide a configurable and re-usable solution accelerator for binary classification cases.</li>
        <li>Auto selects the best classification algorithm for the dataset based on user defined criteria (parameters).</li>
        <li>Uses Azure ML and Azure Dev Ops</li>
    </ul>
