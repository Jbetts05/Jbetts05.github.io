<h2>Accelerator Description</h2>
<p>
    Demand forecasting is a method by which businesses predict customer demand in order to optimize supply planning and management. The perennial challenge of forecasting is that aggregate level forecasts out-perform the accuracy of forecasts that are more fine-grained, e.g. drill down to region, store, sku. Yet, it is the fine-grained forecast that drives effective optimization. Fine-grained forecast accuracy matters.
<p>
    The Demand Forecasting solution accelerator provides the core functionality required in a demand forecasting solution and thus gives you the ability to customize, scale, and perform fine-grain forecasts. The ultimate goal of this accelerator is to be extensible, enabling you to customize it to meet your customer requirements and accelerate the customerâ€™s speed to value.
